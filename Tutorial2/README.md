### Objective

The main objective is improve the app.py build to do the four elementary operations: add, subtraction, division, multiplication.

Here we are build a MongoDB database to store how many times the user requires an operation. If the same user have more than five requirements the app blocks the access. In other words, an user have a limite of five requirements. For that the user can provide the UserName(User) and the PassWord(PW) to the app controls how many times the app was required by user. This information will be stored in a MongoDB databse.
